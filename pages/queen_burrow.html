            <p>The Queenâ€™s Burrow is a 2D, top-down, roguelike dungeon crawler where you play as an ant queen fighting to reclaim her fallen kingdom. 
                Wield powerful weapons and spells, and make ruthless choices by sacrificing your infected colony members for the greater good of the kingdom. 
                Battle through dangerous levels in pursuit of three heirlooms, your only hope 
                at restoring the kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>This game was made by a 25-person student game studio. I worked on the engineering team for this project. I created the base player class architecture and functionality.
                I created the player's dash and UI elements tied to it. 
            </p>
            <p>Later I would work on many of the spells in the game. I deleveped the Stinger Spell Tree, a series of spells that shoot projectiles at 
                enemies, and the Quake Spell Tree, a series of spells that create area of effect damage.
